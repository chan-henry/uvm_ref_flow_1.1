Product	Information
****************************************************************************** 
The UVM Reference Flow applies the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) on
a realistic set of examples, which begin by showing aspects of the verification of
a block, a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART).

It then shows how to verify a cluster design (a APB subsystem) into which the UART
gets integrated along with other design components (viz. SPI, GPIO, Power Controller,
Timers etc)

******************************************************************************
What's New
******************************************************************************

- For UVM sv reference flow

---- 2014.02 release ---------
Minor changes/fixes done in the source code by CVC (A Verification Alliances partner with
Cadence). 
Added Makefile targets to run on all major EDA tools (VCS, Questa, Riviera-pro
to the default Cadence)

Please refer to README_howto_run_it.txt file for more details
------------------------------

This release of the UVM Reference Flow is completely aligned with 
the Universal Verification Methodology UVM 1.1 (uvm-1.1) as released by Accellera.


- For UVM e reference flow

This release also includes a UVM-e Reference Flow which applies the Universal Verification
Methodology in e (UVM-e developed by Cadence) to the same block and cluster level 
Verification of UART and APB subsystem.The sample verification environments (both block 
and cluster level) contain UVCs based on eRM as well as using UVM-e. Both eRM and UVM-e 
compatible UVC's can be nicely integrated together and can work seamlessly. 
Thus, it ensures that all exiting eRM compliant environments need not to be re-coded to 
work with an UVM compatible environment. Usage of UVM-e Scoreboard package is also 
included in this release.

******************************************************************************
UVM Reference Flow Design Overview
******************************************************************************

The UVM Reference Flow design is based on an Ethernet Switch System-on-Chip
(SoC). The SoC has the following key components
  1. An Open RISC Processor 
  2. Open Core Ethernet Media Access controller (MAC)
  3. AMBA AHB network interconnect
  4. Address Look up table (ALUT)
  5. Support and Control functions. For instance power management and peripherals
     like UART, SPI, GPO, timer etc
  6. On-chip Memories and memory controllers


  
******************************************************************************
Getting Started
******************************************************************************

------------------------------
For IES System Verilog users only
------------------------------

  The Makefile uses "-uvmhome" switch to compile the uvm_pkg released 
  by Accellera as uvm-1.1. You need UVM library i.e. uvm-1.1 to be able 
  to run the UVM reference flows. 

  Note: All the flows in this release have been validated on the above mentioned
        library release and Incisive Enterprise Simulator (IES 11.1)

 Once you have untarred and installed the UVM library, do the following

  Set the UVM_HOME environment variable to the UVM Library install area

  - In csh
    % setenv UVM_HOME <UVM Library install area>/uvm-1.1

  - In bash
    % UVM_HOME=<UVM Library install area>/uvm-1.1
    % export UVM_HOME


------------------------------
For Specman 'e' users only  
------------------------------
 
For Cadence customers, IES 11.1 is required to run the UVM e flow


UVM Reference Flow Setup:
-------------------------
  Once you have installed the UVM reference Flow, please do the following in a terminal

  Set the UVM_REF_HOME variable to the installation folder and source the
  env.[c]sh

  - In csh
    %> setenv UVM_REF_HOME <Reference_Flow_install_dir>
    %> source $UVM_REF_HOME/env.csh
    
  - In bash
    %> UVM_REF_HOME=<Reference_Flow_install_dir>
    %> export UVM_REF_HOME
    %> . $UVM_REF_HOME/env.sh
